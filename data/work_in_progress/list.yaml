    In 2005, Brazil began an ambitious attempt at regulating a high-polluting industry: lead-acid battery recycling. They implemented tax breaks for formal (less-polluting) recycling firms, and drove their informal competitors out of business with verification requirements. This led to a centralization of lead battery recycling in a few municipalities that were home to formal recycling factories, increasing their exposure to lead emissions from these factories, which is associated with adverse consequences for children's cognition. Our preliminary results show that the tax break caused a divergence in elementary school student performance between municipalities that did have these factories and those that did not. This supports the hypothesis that lead pollution fell across the country as informal recycling disappeared, while pollution increased near formal firms as those expanded. We are currently incorporating matched employer--employee data from the Relação Anual de Informações Sociais (RAIS), which allows us to estimate a first stage (how much recycling firms grew) and provide some of the first evidence on the effects of lead exposure as a child or young adult on labor market outcomes. Additionally, we are in the process of incorporating data on birth outcomes, which will give us a more direct measure of health impacts. We are hopeful that these additional results will paint a complete picture of the effects of this policy change and allow us to judge whether the template created by Brazil should be copied by the many other countries facing this challenge.

    How can an externality from a polluting activity be internalized when not even the internality from same activity is being internalized? Battery repairmen (people who repair lead-acid batteries) are a ubiquitous but understudied presence in poor countries. Existing evidence suggests that battery repairmen create substantial amounts of lead pollution, causing lead poisoning for themselves and for others, including family members or people who live or work nearby. Repairmen, and the community at large, appear to be unaware of this fact. We propose an information intervention to improve safety practices of battery repairmen in Lagos, Nigeria.

    Why are some countries more corrupt than others? One possibility is that some have regulations that are too complex to effectively be implemented by their resource-constrained enforcement agencies. I write a model of government enforcement of an externality-averting provision that predicts that moving away from the more complex "first-best" provision to a less complex "second-best" provision actually increases externality reduction by decreasing corruption.

    Despite alarmingly high levels of lead poisoning, little is known about the sources of exposure to lead in poor countries, methods to eliminate that exposure, and the gains from doing so. I propose three studies to address these knowledge gaps: (1) An event study using exogenous variation in the timing of leaded gasoline bans across Africa; (2) a randomized experiment that staggers the rollout of a subsidy for lead-free paint; (3) an experiment that cross randomizes publicly available lead-testing equipment with the introduction of a reputable lead-free turmeric vendor.

    We reply to the comments of [Roodman (2022)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.09036) on the data and econometric specifications of [Duflo (2001)](http://doi.org/10.1257/aer.91.4.795). We replicate Roodman’s results and agree with his corrections: standard error clustering, data transcription mistakes, and incorporating survey weights. More importantly, Roodman describes bias in Duflo's DiD specifications as a result of Mincer equation–driven wage scale dilation. We run additional specifications that seek to correct for this bias and find mixed results. Finally, we supplement Roodman's proposal to use later followups — by which point the dilation will have dissipated or even reversed — by using a more complete dataset from [Hsiao (2023)](https://allanhsiao.com/files/Hsiao_schools.pdf) and find significant positive effects, supporting Duflo’s findings. We also discuss additional weak instrument corrections.
