    Despite alarmingly high levels of lead poisoning, little is known about the sources of exposure to lead in poor countries, methods to eliminate that exposure, and the gains from doing so. I propose three studies to address these knowledge gaps: (1) An event study using exogenous variation in the timing of leaded gasoline bans across Africa; (2) a randomized experiment that staggers the rollout of a subsidy for lead-free paint; (3) an experiment that cross randomizes publicly available lead-testing equipment with the introduction of a reputable lead-free turmeric vendor.
