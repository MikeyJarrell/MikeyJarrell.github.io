    Despite alarmingly high levels of lead poisoning, little is known about the sources of exposure to lead in poor countries, methods to eliminate that exposure, and the gains from doing so. I propose three studies to address these knowledge gaps: (1) An event study using exogenous variation in the timing of leaded gasoline bans across Africa; (2) a randomized experiment that staggers the rollout of a subsidy for lead-free paint; (3) an experiment that cross randomizes publicly available lead-testing equipment with the introduction of a reputable lead-free turmeric vendor.

    We reply to the comments of [Roodman (2022)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.09036) on the data and econometric specifications of [Duflo (2001)](http://doi.org/10.1257/aer.91.4.795). We replicate Roodman’s results and agree with his corrections: standard error clustering, data transcription mistakes, and incorporating survey weights. More importantly, Roodman describes bias in Duflo's DiD specifications as a result of Mincer equation–driven wage scale dilation. We run additional specifications that seek to correct for this bias and find mixed results. Finally, we supplement Roodman's proposal to use later followups — by which point the dilation will have dissipated or even reversed — by using a more complete dataset from [Hsiao (2023)](https://allanhsiao.com/files/Hsiao_schools.pdf) and find significant positive effects, supporting Duflo’s findings. We also discuss additional weak instrument corrections.
