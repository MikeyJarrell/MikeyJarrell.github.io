__Golf__: 
I'm a member of [World Long Drive](https://worldlongdrive.com) and [Ultimate Long Drive](https://ultimatelongdrive.com) with a career longest shot of 429 yards and highest World Ranking of 17. I set an amateur world record with a 400 yard drive to win the [2019 Latino Americao Championship](https://ultimatelongdrive.com/mikey-jarrell-conquered-the-grid-at-club-de-golf-la-hacienda/). The highlight of my career was hitting side-by-side with Bryson DeChambeau in the [2021 World Championships](https://www.youtube.com/live/djgTtwO-ibk?si=A4Z-_e7VDtCX4Q55&t=27062).

__Film__: 
Videos that I've written, shot, directed, edited, and produced are at [Average Content](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUi7LTQazUvuEqeBf8wFXFg). They range from short comedy sketches to full documentaries. Our best work is [_El MÃ©todo Cubano_](https://youtu.be/IrIYlYd2B4g?si=3f15CishK0RD1b-F) _(The Cuban Method)_, a documentary on the legacy of ballet in Cuba that aired on PBS in Rochester, NY. See my [IMDb page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4574225/) for some of my credits.

__Journalism__: 
At Bowdoin College, I was a writer for the [school newspaper](http://bowdoinorient.com/bonus/author/780/), a color commentator for live broadcasts of athletic events, and the host of a sports talk radio show (of which a few episodes are [here](https://www.mixcloud.com/mikey-jarrell/)). After college, I wrote for The Sports Quotient, and my [personal blog](http://everybodyisdumb.com).

__Wildlife__: 
I'm a Field Guides Association of Southern Africa [NQF2](https://www.fgasa.co.za/membership/examinations) certified safari guide and mammal specialist, a PADI [Rescue](https://www.padi.com/courses/rescue-diver) certified scuba diver, and an enthusiastic wildlife photographer.

__Teaching__:
I have Cambridge Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (CELTA) from the Institute of Modern Languages (Granada, Spain) and was an English tutor to children in China.
